# trading-tools

Set of CLI tools for working with stock market data.

Some tools require access to gatewayed APIs. Credentials should be added to `inc/config.h` after running `make config` (and inspecting the source code of this whole codebase, of course).

```console
bin/ticker-scraper NASDAQ > nasdaq-and-pink.csv
bin/ticker-scraper --no-csv-header Pink >> nasdaq-and-pink.csv
```
or
